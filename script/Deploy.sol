/// @title Deploy
/// @notice `RainDeployBroadcast` over this repo's one suite declaration:
/// selects a suite by `DEPLOYMENT_SUITE` and deploys it through the Zoltu
/// factory, after anchoring every candidate snapshot to current source.
/// Broadcasts to every network in `LibRainDeploy.supportedNetworks()` — the
/// inherited default — so one dispatch puts the suite's one deterministic
/// address on every supported chain.
///
/// The per-suite `else if` chain this replaces was a second declaration of the
/// same five deployments: it named its own creation codes, addresses, code
/// hashes and dependency lists, and nothing tied them to what the tests
/// checked. The suites are now a registry the abstract iterates, so a
/// mistyped `DEPLOYMENT_SUITE` reports the valid keys built from that same
/// registry.
