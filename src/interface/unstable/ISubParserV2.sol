/// @dev A compatibility version for the subparser interface.
///
/// ## Literal parsing
///
/// The structure of data for this version is:
/// - bytes [0,1]: The length of the dispatch data as 2 bytes.
/// - bytes [2,N-1+2]: The dispatch data, where N is the length of the dispatch
///   data as defined by the first 2 bytes. This is used by the sub parser to
///   decide which literal parser to use. If there are no matches the sub parser
///   MUST return false and MUST NOT revert.
/// - bytes [N+2,...]: The literal data that the sub parser is being asked to
///   parse. The sub parser MUST revert if it cannot parse the literal, once it
///   has determined that it is the correct sub parser to handle the literal.
///
/// ## Word parsing
///
/// The structure of data for this version is:
/// - bytes [0,1]: The current height of the constants array on the main parser.
/// - bytes [2,2]: The IO byte, that at the time of writing represents the
///   number of inputs to the word.
/// - bytes [3,4]; Two bytes that encodes N where N is the length in bytes of the
///   rainlang word that could not be parsed in bytes.
/// - bytes [5, N+5]: A string slice that the parser could not parse. For well
///   formed rainlang it will be a word WITHOUT any associated operands. The
///   parsing of operands is handled by the main parser, and the subparser is
///   only expected to parse the word itself and handle the pre-parsed operand
///   values.
/// - bytes [N+5,...]: The operands that the main parser has already parsed as
///   a standard `uint256[]` array. The subparser is expected to handle these
///   operands as-is, and return bytecode that is compatible with the operand
///   values. The first word of the array is the array length.
