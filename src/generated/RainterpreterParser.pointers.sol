/// @dev The parse meta that is used to lookup word definitions.
/// The structure of the parse meta is:
/// - 1 byte: The depth of the bloom filters
/// - 1 byte: The hashing seed
/// - The bloom filters, each is 32 bytes long, one for each build depth.
/// - All the items for each word, each is 4 bytes long. Each item's first byte
///   is its opcode index, the remaining 3 bytes are the word fingerprint.
/// To do a lookup, the word is hashed with the seed, then the first byte of the
/// hash is compared against the bloom filter. If there is a hit then we count
/// the number of 1 bits in the bloom filter up to this item's 1 bit. We then
/// treat this a the index of the item in the items array. We then compare the
/// word fingerprint against the fingerprint of the item at this index. If the
/// fingerprints equal then we have a match, else we increment the seed and try
/// again with the next bloom filter, offsetting all the indexes by the total
/// bit count of the previous bloom filter. If we reach the end of the bloom
/// filters then we have a miss.
